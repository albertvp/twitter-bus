# Twitter hook for bus.io

It needs a Twitter applications stored on config: rename the `config.example.js file` to `config.js`.

It uses express, passport and bus.io.  It is **simple**.  There are lots of things to imporove on.

Start the server by doing this first.

    > cd twitter-bus
    > npm install
    > node app.js

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.  If you find problems please fork and send a pull request :)
